# SwiftUI-Menu-Bug

This repository illustrates a bug with SwiftUI Menu not presenting it's options modally. Meaning when the Menu is presenting it's options, it can still trigger actions on other UI elements.

Whereas, on UIKit, UIButton with menu as primary action will prevent activation of other UI elements when it's menu is showing.
